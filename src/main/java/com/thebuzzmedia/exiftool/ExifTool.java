/**
 * Class used to provide a Java-like wrapper to Phil Harvey's excellent <a
 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifTool</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Instances of this class are <strong>not</strong> Thread-safe. Both the
 * instance of this class and external ExifTool process maintain state specific
 * to the current operation. Use of instances of this class need to be
 * synchronized using an external mechanism or in a highly threaded environment
 * (e.g. web application), instances of this class can be used along with
 * {@link ThreadLocal}s to ensure Thread-safe, highly parallel use.
 * <p/>
 * There are a number of other basic wrappers to ExifTool available online, but
 * most of them only abstract out the actual Java-external-process execution
 * logic and do no additional work to make integration with the external
 * ExifTool any easier or intuitive.
 * <p/>
 * This class was written in order to make integration with ExifTool inside of a
 * Java application seamless, performant and easy whether you use the imgscalr
 * library or not.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * Assuming ExifTool is installed on the host system correctly and either in the
 * system path or pointed at correctly by {@link #EXIF_TOOL_PATH}, using this
 * class to communicate with ExifTool is as simple as creating an instance (
 * <code>ExifTool tool = new ExifTool()</code>) and then making calls to
 * {@link #getImageMeta(File, Tag...)} with the list of {@link Tag} values you
 * wish to pull from the source image.
 * <p/>
 * In this default mode, calls to {@link #getImageMeta(File, Tag...)} will
 * automatically start an external ExifTool process to handle the request. After
 * ExifTool has parsed the tag values from the file, the external process exits
 * and this class parses the result.
 * <p/>
 * Results from calls to {@link #getImageMeta(File, Tag...)} are returned in a
 * {@link Map} with the {@link Tag} values as the keys and {@link String} values
 * for every tag that had a value in the image file. {@link Tag}s with no value
 * found in the image are omitted from the result map.
 * <p/>
 * It is up to the caller to decide how best to parse and convert the resulting
 * {@link String} values (e.g. convert to numbers, enums, etc.).
 * <p/>
 * In order to make use of the new <code>-stay_open</code> daemon mode supported
 * by ExifTool 8.36 and later, simply pass <code>true</code> to the constructor
 * of this class when creating an instance:
 * <code>ExifTool tool = new ExifTool(true)</code> - this will cause a daemon
 * version of ExifTool to be spun up and reused for all subsequent calls to
 * {@link #getImageMeta(File, Tag...)}.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>REMINDER</strong>: When you use this mode, you must be sure to
 * explicitly call {@link #close()} when you are done using ExifTool so this
 * class has a chance to stop the external ExifTool process and cleanup the
 * read/write streams used to communicate with it.
 * <p/>
 * Forgetting to do this will not only leak resources inside the VM, but leak
 * <code>exiftool</code> processes in the host OS.
 * <h3>ExifTool -stay_open Support</h3>
 * ExifTool <a href=
 * "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg12933.html#msg12933"
 * >8.36</a> added a new persistent-process feature that allows ExifTool to stay
 * running in a daemon mode and continue accepting commands via a file or stdin.
 * <p/>
 * This new mode is controlled via the <code>-stay_open True/False</code>
 * command line argument and in a busy system can offer speed improvements of up
 * to <strong>40-60x</strong> (yes, really that much).
 * <p/>
 * This feature was added to ExifTool shortly after user <a
 * href="http://www.christian-etter.de/?p=458">Christian Etter discovered</a>
 * the overhead for starting up a new Perl interpreter each time ExifTool is
 * loaded accounts for roughly <a href=
 * "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg6121.html#msg6121"
 * >98.4% of the total runtime</a>.
 * <p/>
 * If <code>-stay_open</code> support is enabled in this class by passing
 * <code>true</code> to the constructor, but the installed copy of ExifTool is
 * older than 8.36 on the host system, in order to avoid a potential lockup,
 * this class will actually make an attempt at verifying the version of ExifTool
 * used before trying to run in daemon mode. Once the version of the installed
 * ExifTool has been verified, the check will not be performed again for the
 * life of the instance of this class.
 * <p/>
 * If the version is confirmed to be lower than the required ExifTool version to
 * support that feature, a {@link RuntimeException} is thrown to notify the
 * caller of the situation.
 * <p/>
 * At that point the developer can either upgrade ExifTool or not use it in
 * daemon mode to work around the exception.
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * Extra care is taken to ensure minimal object creation or unnecessary CPU
 * overhead while communicating with the external process.
 * <p/>
 * {@link Pattern}s used to split the responses from the process are explicitly
 * compiled and reused, string concatenation is minimized, Tag name lookup is
 * done via a <code>static final</code> {@link Map} shared by all instances and
 * so on.
 * <p/>
 * Additionally, extra care is taken to utilize the most optimal code paths when
 * initiating and using the external process, for example, the
 * {@link ProcessBuilder#command(List)} method is used to avoid the copying of
 * array elements when {@link ProcessBuilder#command(String...)} is used and
 * avoiding the (hidden) use of {@link StringTokenizer} when
 * {@link Runtime#exec(String)} is called.
 * <p/>
 * All of this effort was done to ensure that imgscalr and its supporting
 * classes continue to provide best-of-breed performance and memory utilization
 * in long running/high performance environments (e.g. web applications).
 * <h3>Why ExifTool?</h3>
 * <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifTool</a> is
 * written in Perl and requires an external process call from Java to make use
 * of.
 * <p/>
 * While this would normally preclude a piece of software from inclusion into
 * the imgscalr library (more complex integration), there is no other image
 * metadata piece of software available as robust, complete and well-tested as
 * ExifTool. In addition, ExifTool already runs on all major platforms
 * (including Windows), so there was not a lack of portability introduced by
 * providing an integration for it.
 * <p/>
 * Allowing it to be used from Java is a boon to any Java project that needs the
 * ability to read/write image-metadata from almost <a
 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/#supported">any image or
 * video file</a> format.
 * <h3>Alternatives</h3>
 * If integration with an external Perl process is something your app cannot do
 * and you still need image metadata-extraction capability, Drew Noakes has
 * written the 2nd most robust image metadata library I have come across: <a
 * href="http://drewnoakes.com/drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">Metadata Extractor</a>
 * that you might want to look at.
